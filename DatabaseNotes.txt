Relationships and constraints
	Structural Constraints
		Cardinality Ratio 	[maximum]
		Participation/existential Constraints [minimum]

#1 (1:N) relationship
	Requirement: every employee works for a department; and a department can have many employees. A new department need not have any employees
	1 Degree of the relationship
		num of entities in the relationship: (2)
	2 Cardinality ration
		max number of relationships that an instance of the entity can participate in: emp(1) Dept(n)
	3 Minimum Emp(1) Dept(0)

		Emp	Dept
	Max	1	N
	Min	1	0

	Cardinality rep
		[emp]===========<Works for>-----------[Dept]
			N			1

	Min-max rep
		[emp]-----------<works for>-----------[Dept]
			(1,1)			(0,N)


#2 (1:1) relationship
	Every Dpartment must have a manager, and only one employee manages a department, an employee can manage only one department
	[Emp]---------<manages>--------[Dept]
		(0,1)		(1,1)	

	1 Degree: 2
	2 Cardinality(max) 	Emp(1) 	Dept(1)
	3 Minimum		Emp(0) 	Dept(1)
	
		Emp	Dept
	Max	1	1
	min	0	1

#3 (N:M) Every employee has to work on at least 1 project; every project should have at least 1 employee

	1 degree: 2
	2 Max	emp(n)	proj(M)
	3 min	emp(1)	proj(1)

	[emp]------<works on>-----(proj)
	     (1,N)           (1,M)

#4 Recursive Relationship
	Every employee is supervised by a supervisor who is an employee
		except for CEO, has no boss
	(still use 3 ovals, just add designation of supervisor/supervise)	

	1 Degree 	2
	2 Max	emp(1)	sup(N)
	3 Min	emp(0)	sup(0)

	---<supervise>---
	|		|
	|		|
	------<emp>------
	(0,N)	   (0,1)
